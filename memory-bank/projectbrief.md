# Project Brief

This project is the Investor Q&A Assistant, designed to facilitate answering investor questions using AI. The system integrates multiple AI language models and embedding stores to process and respond to queries based on uploaded PDF documents and other data sources. The project includes both backend and frontend components, with a focus on modular interfaces to different AI providers and a user-friendly React-based frontend.

The core goals are:

- Provide accurate, context-aware answers to investor questions.
- Support multiple AI models and embedding stores.
- Allow easy upload and management of PDF documents as knowledge sources.
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between backend AI logic and frontend UI.
- Ensure extensibility for adding new AI models or data sources.

The project is structured with a Python backend and a React frontend, using modern best practices for API design and UI development.
